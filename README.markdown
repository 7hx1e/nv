### Just a quick fork

I actually hadn't noticed that another fork of Notational Velocity had already done the MultiMarkdown upgrade, but this was just a quick mod, so I'm going with it.

This version makes a few minor visual tweaks. I won't detail them all, but it's about a third of what I actually want to do with it. I need more free time. There are also a LOT of changes to the CSS in the preview window, as there really wasn't *any* before.

In addition to the inline MultiMarkdown preview, there's an HTML source view tab for grabbing the rendered source instead of rich text.

* TODO: Render notes as fragments instead of complete documents.
* TODO: Add options for custom CSS in Preview
